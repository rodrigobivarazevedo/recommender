## Installation

1. **Run with Docker Compose**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

This will build and start the application using the provided `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` files. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

## Usage


1. **Open your browser** and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

2. **Get recommendations**:
   - Go to the "Get Recommendations" page
   - Choose one of the three recommendation modes:
     
     **1. Find Similar Episodes**
     - Enter the title of a podcast episode you enjoy
     - Select the number of recommendations (3, 5, or 10)
     - Click "Find Similar Episodes" to see AI-generated suggestions based on content and metadata similarity

     **2. Random Playlist**
     - Select the number of episodes for your playlist (3, 5, or 10)
     - Click "Generate Random Playlist" to discover a handpicked set of similar episodes starting from a random show

     **3. Health Goals & Concerns**
     - Describe your health goal, concern, or a topic you're interested in (e.g., "improve sleep quality", "nutrition for weight loss")
     - Optionally, set a maximum episode duration
     - Select the number of recommendations (3, 5, or 10)
     - Click "Find Health-Focused Episodes" to get personalized suggestions based on your input

## How It Works

### Three Recommendation Modes

1. **Find Similar Episodes (Item-based)**
   - Enter a podcast episode title you like
   - The system finds and recommends episodes most similar to your chosen episode, using a combination of transcript and metadata embeddings

2. **Random Playlist**
   - The system randomly selects a starting episode and builds a playlist of similar episodes
   - Great for discovering new content when you don’t have a specific topic or episode in mind

3. **Health Goals & Concerns (Content-based)**
   - Describe your health goal, concern, or a topic you’re interested in
   - The system analyzes your input and recommends episodes whose content best matches your interests, using advanced semantic search on episode transcripts

### Embedding-Based Recommendation System
The system uses two types of pre-computed embeddings:

1. **Transcript Embeddings** (`transcript_embedding_mean`): 
   - Captures the semantic meaning of podcast content
   - Weight: 70% in final similarity calculation

2. **Metadata Embeddings** (`metadata_embedding`):
   - Captures information about titles, hosts, and other metadata
   - Weight: 30% in final similarity calculation

### Recommendation Process
- **Find Similar Episodes**: Finds the closest match to your input title, then recommends the most similar episodes using combined embeddings and cosine similarity
- **Random Playlist**: Picks a random episode and recommends similar ones using the same similarity approach
- **Health Goals & Concerns**: Encodes your free-text input and finds episodes whose transcript embeddings are most similar to your query

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Landing page
- `GET /recommendations` - Recommendations form page
- `POST /get_recommendations` - API endpoint to get podcast recommendations based on title
- `POST /get_random_playlist` - API endpoint to get a random playlist of podcast recommendations
- `POST /get_content_recommendations` - API endpoint to get recommendations based on user's health goals or concerns
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint

## Data Requirements

The application expects podcast data in CSV format with the following columns:
- `title`: Podcast title
- `host`: Podcast host name
- `transcript`: Full transcript text
- `transcript_embedding_mean`: Pre-computed transcript embeddings using mean pooling
- `metadata_embedding`: Pre-computed metadata embeddings
- `duration_min`: Duration in minutes

The system automatically loads data from `../podcast_youtube_recommender/embedded_podcast_youtube_data.csv`.

## Features in Detail

### Advanced Recommendation Algorithm
- **Dual Embedding Approach**: Combines transcript and metadata embeddings
- **Weighted Similarity**: Configurable weights for different embedding types
- **Cosine Similarity**: Industry-standard similarity metric
- **Real-time Processing**: Fast similarity calculations

### Modern User Interface
- Clean, health-themed design with green color scheme

## Customization

### Embedding Weights
Modify the weights in `main.py`:
```python
transcript_weight = 0.7  # Weight for transcript embeddings
metadata_weight = 0.3    # Weight for metadata embeddings
```

### Styling
- Modify `static/css/style.css` to change colors, fonts, and layout
- Update CSS variables in `:root` for consistent theming
- Add new animations in the CSS file

### Functionality
- Extend `main.py` with additional API endpoints
- Modify the recommendation algorithm in the `PodcastRecommendationSystem` class
- Add new features in `static/js/main.js`

## Development

### Running in Development Mode
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### API Documentation
Once running, visit:
- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- ReDoc: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

### Testing
Test the health endpoint:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Embeddings not loading**: Ensure the CSV file contains the required embedding columns
2. **Memory issues**: Large embedding files may require more RAM
3. **Dependencies not found**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. **Port already in use**: Change the port in the uvicorn command

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting the log level:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --log-level debug
```

## Performance Notes

- **Embedding Loading**: Initial startup may take longer with large embedding files
- **Memory Usage**: Embeddings are loaded into memory for fast similarity calculations
- **Scalability**: Consider using approximate nearest neighbor search for very large datasets
